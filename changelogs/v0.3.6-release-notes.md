# Arion v0.3.6 - MCP Testing & UI Refinements

## What's New

### MCP Server Connection Testing
Test your MCP server connections before saving. The new testing feature validates your configuration and shows discovered tools.

### Smarter Agent Planning
Agents now intelligently decide when to plan. Simple requests execute immediately, while complex multi-tool tasks get a brief plan first.

### Dynamic Tool Discovery
The Agent Editor now dynamically fetches available tools, so newly added MCP server tools appear immediately.

### Streamdown Markdown Rendering
Upgraded to Streamdown for better streaming support, Shiki syntax highlighting, and native GFM/math/Mermaid support.

## UI Improvements

- Refined dark theme with new button colors (purple send, amber new chat)
- Consistent card backgrounds across pages
- Better input field visibility
- Renamed "Integrations" to "Connectors"

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed line break preservation in chat input
- Fixed MCP tools not appearing in agent editor after adding new servers

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22+** is now required for development
