You need to decompose the following task into specific subtasks that can be assigned to different specialized agents.

USER TASK: {{query}}

You have access to the following specialized agents that can help accomplish tasks:

{{agents_info}}

Using these available agents, generate a list of subtasks in JSON format. For each subtask include:
1. A clear, specific description of what needs to be done
2. A list of capabilities required to complete it
3. Dependencies (IDs of other subtasks this one depends on)

Example format:
[
  {
    "description": "Analyze the spatial data to identify areas with high vegetation density",
    "requiredCapabilities": ["raster-analysis", "vector-analysis"],
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "description": "Visualize vegetation density on the map",
    "requiredCapabilities": ["visualization", "map-control"],
    "dependencies": ["1"] 
  }
]

Make sure to break down the task logically and include all steps needed to complete the original task.
