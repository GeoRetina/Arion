# Arion: Geospatial AI Assistant

Arion is a modular and extensible desktop application designed for advanced geospatial analysis and agentic workflows. Built with Electron, React (TypeScript), and Vite, Arion empowers users to leverage local and cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs), integrate custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and utilize a plugin system for extended capabilities.

## Core Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Communicate with LLMs for geospatial queries, analysis, and task automation. Supports various providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Azure, Anthropic, Ollama) via the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Dynamic Map Visualization:** Render and interact with geospatial data using MapLibre GL.
- **LLM Tool Integration:**
  - Built-in tools for map manipulation (add features, buffers, set view), UI control, and knowledge base queries.
  - Support for user-defined MCP servers, allowing agents to access external Python/TypeScript tools and data sources.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Ingest documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) into a local vector store (PGlite with pgvector) for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
- **Local LLM Support:** Configure and use local LLMs via Ollama.
- **Agentic Workflows (Planned):** Future support for running Python (LangGraph/CrewAI) and TypeScript agents in isolated processes, orchestrated by the application.
- **Plugin System (Planned):** Extend Arion's functionality with custom plugins for data connectors, visualization providers, MCP tools, and agent providers.
- **SQLite/SpatiaLite Backend:** Manages application settings, chat history, and plugin configurations. SpatiaLite for advanced geospatial data operations (integration in progress).
